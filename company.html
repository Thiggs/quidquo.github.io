   <h2>Company/Entity Contributions Search</h2>
   <p>This tool displays a a breakdown of the amount of money spent by a company or other entity, which candidates they have contributed the most to. All data represents contributions as reported to the State of Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board (IECD). It includes contributions to all active state and local candidates in Iowa who report to the IECD. It does not include contributions to federal level candidates (e.g., US Senators or US Representatives) as those contributions are reported to the Federal Election Commission. Data is most up to date after reporting deadlines for candidates and committees. See <a href="https://ethics.iowa.gov/reports/campaign-due-dates/campaign-reporting-deadlines" target="_blank">this listing of Iowa Ethics reporting deadlines for more information.</a></p>
